In lab 4 we wrote a testbench for our processor. The testbench was responsible
for driving the inputs to the processor (\textbf{CLK}, \textbf{ARESETN} and
\textbf{master\_load\_enable}), as well as checking the correctnes of the
outputs from the processor. The processor was given a simple example program to
run, this program is given in figure \ref{code:lab4}

    Load Byte 00000001  // ACC = DM[1]
    Add 00000000        // ACC = ACC + DM[0]
    Display             // Move ACC to Display Reg
    Store byte 00000001 // DM[1] = acc
    subtract 00000000   // ACC = ACC - DM[0]
    Store 00000000      // DM[0] = ACC;
    Jump 00000000       // start over
