In lab 4 we wrote a testbench for our processor. The testbench was responsible
for driving the inputs to the processor (\textbf{CLK}, \textbf{ARESETN} and
\textbf{master\_load\_enable}), as well as checking the correctnes of the
outputs from the processor. The testbench ran a simple example program on the
processor, and was given the correct outputs for this program. The program code
is given in figure \ref{code:lab4}. 
\subsection*{Driving the inputs}
Driving the inputs was a
straightforward process. We begun by driving the clock (\textbf{CLK})
switching its value between 1 and 0 every 5ns. Giving the clock a period of
10ns. We then added a process with \textbf{CLK} as its only dependency to drive
the other two inputs. In this process, the master load enable signal is toggled
every time the \textbf{CLK} is changed. On every rising edge of \textbf{CLK} the
process increments a counter \textbf{CLK\_step}, when this counter is below 2
the reset signal is active (\textbf{ARESETN} = 0), when the counter is 2 or
higher the reset signal is inactive (\textbf{ARESETN} = 1).
\subsection*{Controlling the outputs}
The correct outptus for the example program in figure \ref{code:lab4} was given
in
